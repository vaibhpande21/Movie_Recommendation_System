This project implements a **Movie Recommendation System** using collaborative filtering techniques, including **item-item** and **user-user** approaches, as well as **matrix factorization**. The system recommends movies to users based on their preferences and similarities with other users or movies.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their historical ratings and preferences. The system uses collaborative filtering techniques, including:
- **Item-Item Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends movies similar to the ones a user has liked.
- **User-User Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends movies liked by users with similar preferences.
- **Matrix Factorization**: Decomposes the user-movie interaction matrix to identify latent factors and make recommendations.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of three files:
1. **`ratings.dat`**: Contains user-movie ratings in the format `UserID::MovieID::Rating::Timestamp`.
2. **`users.dat`**: Contains user demographic information in the format `UserID::Gender::Age::Occupation::Zip-code`.
3. **`movies.dat`**: Contains movie information in the format `MovieID::Title::Genres`.

### Dataset Statistics
- **Users**: 6,040
- **Movies**: 3,952
- **Ratings**: 1,000,209
- **Genres**: 18 unique genres (e.g., Action, Comedy, Drama)

## Features

### Data Preprocessing
- Extracted release year from movie titles.
- Handled missing and incorrect data.
- Binned age groups and mapped occupations to meaningful labels.
- Created interaction matrices for collaborative filtering.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed the distribution of ratings, movie releases, and user demographics.
- Visualized top genres by age group and most-rated movies.

### Recommendation Techniques
1. **Item-Item Collaborative Filtering**:
   - Used Pearson correlation and cosine similarity to find similar movies.
2. **User-User Collaborative Filtering**:
   - Used cosine similarity to find similar users.
3. **Matrix Factorization**:
   - Used the `CMF` library to decompose the user-movie interaction matrix and generate recommendations.

## Approaches

1. **Item-Item Collaborative Filtering**:
   - For a given movie, the system recommends movies with the highest correlation or cosine similarity.

2. **User-User Collaborative Filtering**:
   - For a given user, the system recommends movies liked by users with similar preferences.

3. **Matrix Factorization**:
   - Decomposed the user-movie interaction matrix into latent factors to predict user preferences.

4. **Nearest Neighbors**:
   - Used K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) with cosine similarity to recommend movies.

## Results
Key Findings

- Most movies are rated 4.0, indicating a positive bias in user ratings.
- The majority of movies were released in the 1990s.
- Users aged 25-34 are the most active movie consumers.
- Males consume more content than females.
- College students are the largest group of media consumers.

## Recommendation Examples

- For the movie "Pulp Fiction", the system recommended 4 matching movies compared to Google's recommendations.
- For UserID 237 & 1002, the system recommended movies aligned with their preferred genres.
